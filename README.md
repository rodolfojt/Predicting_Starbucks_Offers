# Recommending Starbucks Offers

The goal of this project is to create a recomendation system to send Startbucks 
product offers to users based on demographic and offer type. The model will be 
deployed using Amazon Sagemaker and the will be consumed through a web-app. 
The tasks involved are the following:

1. Exploring and cleaning the data;
2. Traing a estimator that can predict how much someone will spent according 
to the offer received;
3. Building an API using Amazon API Gateway and make the estimator run on 
a web-app;
4. Make the web-app predicts a how much a user will spend in each offer to 
the next few days.

This was the final project in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program 
from Udacity.
